# Convert WET 3 classes to WET 4 classes

This tool searches for WET 3 classes in an html document and converts them to their WET 4 equivalents.

This tool only applies one-to-one replacements; it does not apply any circumstantial replacements. For example, in WET 3, "align-center" is used to align text. In WET 4, "text-center" should be used for text, whereas "center-block" should be used for content blocks. this tool does not attempt to replace "align-center".
