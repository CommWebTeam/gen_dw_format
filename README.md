# Initial formatting for Dreamweaver pastes
Performs some basic string formatting on the HTML documents generated by pasting word documents into Dreamweaver to help conform the documents to WCAG/WET standards.

[HTML document here.](basic_format.html)

The current formatting checks done are as follows (the user can select which to apply):
- make all space hexcodes consistent by converting invisible non-breaking spaces (when it just looks like a regular space in the editor) into regular spaces.
- replaces all multispaces with single spaces. You should probably apply source formatting in Dreamweaver to fix indentation if you include this check.
- removes lines that only consist of spaces or nbsp;
- replaces word's fancy quotes with regular quotes.
- replaces word's em dashes with regular dashes.
- removes the referential links that Dreamweaver generates (which don't properly function).
- ensures that internal links to the OSFI website are relative, and adds rel=external to external links. It also ignores links with a few keywords indicating footnotes, table of contents, already existing internal links, and email addresses.
- replaces the formatting for Dreamweaver-generated table of contents with WET table of contents.

This is not intended to be an in-depth formatting tool and only covers some basic initial steps. I sometimes split regex statements up into multiple calls for clarity, but all of these checks except for the last two can be done in a single regex statement.
