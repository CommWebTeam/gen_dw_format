# Initial formatting for Dreamweaver pastes
Performs some basic string formatting on the HTML documents generated by pasting Word documents into Dreamweaver to help conform the documents to WCAG/WET standards. It assumes proper indentation (in Dreamweaver, you can generate this with Edit -> Code -> Apply Source Formatting).

[HTML page of tool here.](dw_paste_format.html)

The current formatting checks are as follows (the user can select which to apply). Checks that are generally applicable to all Dreamweaver-pasted documents are checked by default; checks that may only be useful for specific documents are unchecked by default.

- Remove Dreamweaver-generated links:
    - removes the referential links that Dreamweaver generates (which don't properly function).
        - checked by default
    - removes the table of contents links that Dreamweaver generates (which don't properly function).
        - checked by default
    - removes the bookmark links that Dreamweaver generates (which don't properly function).
        - checked by default
    - removes the French logiterms that Dreamweaver generates (which don't properly function).
        - checked by default

- Clean up spacing for coding style:
    - makes all space hexcodes consistent by converting invisible non-breaking spaces (where it just looks like a regular space in the editor) into regular spaces.
        - checked by default
    - replaces all multispaces with single spaces for neatness. You should apply source formatting in Dreamweaver to fix indentation if you include this check.
        - checked by default
    - removes spaces at the end of tags.
        - checked by default
    - removes empty attribute-less tags, and replaces all attribute-less tags that consist solely of spaces or nbsp; with a single regular space. This excludes br and td tags.
        - checked by default
    - removes extra spaces before closing p, li, th, td, and header (h1, h2 etc.) tags for neatness.
        - checked by default

- Replace word-formatted fancy quotes/dashes:
    - replaces fancy quotes with regular quotes.
        - not checked by default
    - replaces the HTML entities for fancy quotes rsquo, lsquo, rdquo, and ldquo with regular quotes.
        - not checked by default
    - replaces the HTML entities for fancy quotes rsquo, lsquo, rdquo, and ldquo with their actual values.
        - not checked by default
    - replaces Word's em dashes with regular dashes.
        - checked by default

- Join consecutive tags of the same type:
    - joins consecutive em and strong tags that are only separated by spaces into a single tag.
        - checked by default
    - joins consecutive ul tags into a single list.
        - checked by default
    - joins consecutive ol tags into a single list.
        - checked by default
        - this should be unchecked if the input document is already WET formatted, as the ol lists may have been purposefully split up due to differing numbering systems (e.g. if the first ol list is lower-alpha while the second is lower-roman).

- Replace em/strong with other tags for italics/bold. These checks take precedence in the given order. For example, if both "change em tags to cite tags on lines that have links" and "change all em tags to i tags" are checked, then the first check will take precedence. So on lines that have links, em tags will be changed to cite tags, and on other lines without links, em tags will be changed to i tags.
    - changes em tags to cite tags on lines that have links. If a line contains the "a" tag, then all em tags on the same line are changed to cite tags.
        - checked by default
    - changes all em tags to cite tags.
        - not checked by default
    - changes all em tags to span class="osfi-txt--italic" tags. (The above two checks take precedence.)
        - not checked by default
    - changes all em tags to i tags. (The above three checks take precedence.)
        - not checked by default
    - changes all strong tags to span class="osfi-txt--bold" tags.
        - not checked by default
    - changes all strong tags to b tags. (The above check takes precedence.)
        - not checked by default

- Replace/remove/format &lt;br> tags:
    - splits up blocks of text that are separated from each other by br within a single &lt;p> tag, by moving each block into its own &lt;p> tag.
        - not checked by default
    - splits up blocks of text that are separated from each other by br within a single &lt;p> tag, by moving each block into its own &lt;p> tag, if the chunk before the br ends in one of the following punctuation symbols: . , ; : ! ? ) " ’ ”
        - checked by default
    - removes br tags at the start or end of p, li, td, th, and header (h1, h2 etc.) tags e.g. if a line consists of &lt;p> &lt;br>x &lt;/p>, the  &lt;br> is removed.
        - checked by default
    - changes all &lt;br> to &lt;br/>.
        - checked by default

- Add/fix/remove tag attributes:
    - ensures that internal links to the OSFI website are relative by removing the OSFI main page from the URL, and adds rel=external to external links. This ignores links that have keywords indicating footnotes, table of contents, already existing internal links, or email addresses.
        - checked by default
    - replaces Dreamweaver-generated center and right alignment (looks like align="center" or align="right") with their respective WET classes.
        - checked by default
    - removes attributes from p (paragraph) tags.
        - checked by default
        - this should be unchecked if the input document is already WET formatted, as the attributes may have been manually inserted.
    - removes attributes from ol and ul tags.
        - checked by default
        - this should be unchecked if the input document is already WET formatted, as the attributes may have been manually inserted.
    - removes attributes from table, th, and tr tags, and removes attributes from td tags except for colspan and rowspan.
        - checked by default
        - this should be unchecked if the input document is already WET formatted, as the attributes may have been manually inserted.

- Format Dreamweaver footnotes:
    - replaces the formatting for Dreamweaver-generated footnotes with WET footnotes. This uses helper functions from the [footnote_formatter tool](https://commwebteam.github.io/gen_dw_format/footnote_formatter/). It assumes Dreamweaver formatting for the footnotes; the footnote formatter tool should be used if this is not the case.
        - checked by default

- Fix spacing issues surrounding punctuation:
    - replaces common punctuation/spacing misformattings:
        - " ." and ".." with "."
        - " ," and ",," with ","
        - " ;" and ";;" with ";"
        - ": :" and "::" with ":"
        
        - checked by default

- Translate structure for French documents:
    - translates internal links to French by searching for /Eng/ and replacing with /Fra/, and translates the WET footnote structure created by the WET footnote formatting check directly above to French.
        - not checked by default
    - replaces 1er with 1&lt;sup>er&lt;/sup>, and other French list numberings formatted as #e with #&lt;sup>e&lt;/sup>.
        - not checked by default
    - ensures that "%" and "$" symbols have an &amp;nbsp; in front of them (for French spacing around those punctuation symbols).
        - not checked by default

- Convert manually inserted fake tags to actual tags (see below):
    - changes strings indicating superscript and subscript tags in the original Word document to be actual tags, and joins these tags together.
        - checked by default
    - changes strings indicating math tags in the original Word document to be actual tags.
        - checked by default

In my implementations, I sometimes split regex statements up into multiple calls for clarity, but a lot of these checks can be done in one or two regex statements.

This is not intended to be an in-depth formatting tool and only covers some basic initial steps.

## Details on changing strings indicating tags to actual tags

### Superscripts and subscripts

For the second last check, the tool looks for the following strings in the html document:
- &amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;, which displays as &lt;sup&gt;
- &amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;, which displays as &lt;sub&gt;

and converts them to tags (so that we have a sup or sub tag in that location instead).

This check is to be used in conjunction with some manual find-and-replace in the original Word document before pasting into Dreamweaver. The idea is that when pasting a Word document into Dreamweaver, it doesn't pay attention to superscripts and subscripts, so you have to manually insert them into Dreamweaver's generated html document. The easiest way to do this involves marking down where these superscripts and subscripts are in the Word document before pasting.

For this tool, you should mark superscripts and subscripts in the Word document with &lt;sup>, &lt;/sup>, &lt;sub>, and &lt;/sub>, as described below.

This tool looks for strings indicating subscript/superscript tags in the html document (where the angle brackets <> have been converted to their html entities by Dreamweaver) and changes them to be actual tags. Afterwards, it joins consecutive sup and sub tags.

#### Steps to mark superscripts and subscripts in Word

1. Open the "replace" box in Word (ctrl+h).
2. Select "More >>" for additional options.
3. Check "Use wildcards". This is a pattern searcher used by Word that is similar to regex.
4. In the "Find what" box, enter ([!(^2)]). This is equivalent to ([^(^2)]) in regex, where ^2 is the character for a footnote/endnote in Word. In other words, we are searching for superscripts that aren't footnotes/endnotes.
5. While in the "Find what" box, select "Format", then "Font".
6. Only check the "Superscript" box. Leave the "Subscript" box unchecked; all other boxes should be filled in, but not checked.
7. Click "OK". You are now searching for superscript text.
8. In the "Replace with" box, enter &lt;sup>\1&lt;/sup>. This is equivalent to &lt;sup>$1&lt;/sup> in regex.
9. While in the "Replace with" box, select "Format", then "Font".
10. Only check the "Superscript" box. Leave the "Subscript" box unchecked; all other boxes should be filled in, but not checked.
11. Click "OK". You are now replacing superscript text.
12. Click "Replace All" to surround all superscripts with &lt;sup> and &lt;/sup>.

Afterwards, repeat these steps for subscripts.

### Mathml

For the last check, the tool looks for the following strings:
- &amp;lt;&ast;math.&ast;?&amp;gt;
- &amp;lt;&ast;mi.&ast;?&amp;gt;
- &amp;lt;&ast;mo.&ast;?&amp;gt;
- &amp;lt;&ast;mn.&ast;?&amp;gt;

and replaces them with actual tags.

Similarly to superscripts/subscripts, you can't copy a Word document with equations into Dreamweaver and have the equations formatted properly (assuming you want them formatted as mathml). Since you need to actually copy the equations one-by-one to have them written out as mathml instead of the default linear format, this is best done with a macro, which can be found [here](https://github.com/CommWebTeam/vba/blob/main/ReplaceMathML.vb). The linked macro replaces equations with their mathml code, which this tool then fixes the tags of once the Word document is pasted into Dreamweaver.

# Adding checks

The steps to add a check that follows the tool's current formatting/organization are as follows:

1. In dw_paste_format.html: Add the new check into the form where the other checks are located. Different groups of checks are separated by two &lt;br/> instead of one; put the check in whichever group you think makes the most sense.
2. In dw_paste_format_helpers.js:
    - In format_file(), create an if statement for the new check, positioned at the same place as where you put it in the HTML document. For the sake of consistency, put the logic for the check in a helper function even if it's only one line.
    - Create the helper function below format_file(), positioned at the same place as where you put it in the HTML document.
3. In README.md (this file): Add a description of the new check in the first section, positioned at the same place as where you put it in the HTML document.
4. In sample_page.html: Add some text to test the new check with.
